* Introduction
This is the source code for the paper "Strong First Order Electroweak Phase Transition from a Natually Light Singlet Scalar".

* Mass spectrum and parametrization
The scalar mass spectrum are calculated in Mathematica code [[file:mass_spectrum/mass_spectrum.nb][mass_spectrum.nb]].
Masses for other relevant particles such as gauge bosons and fermions are trivial, and did not included in any code.

We need to transfer from the bare parameters to observable physical parameters. This process is performed both by hand and by Mathematica in the same [[file:mass_spectrum/mass_spectrum.nb][Mathematica code]]. The hand-written calculation can be found in [[file:mass_spectrum/Parametrization.pdf][PDf file]].
