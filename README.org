* Model setup
This section talks about some fundamental features of this new model. The problems talked here are related to new physics at zero temperature.
** Mass spectrum and parametrization
The scalar mass spectrum are calculated in Mathematica code [[file:model_setup/mass_spectrum.nb][mass_spectrum.nb]].
Masses for other relevant particles such as gauge bosons and fermions are trivial, and did not included in any code.

We need to transfer from the bare parameters to observable physical parameters. This process is performed by Mathematica in the same [[file:model_setup/mass_spectrum.nb][code]].
** Vacuum stability
The vacuum stability is calculated with the modified version of =simplebounce= code. The model file is written in [[file:model_setup/benchmark.cc][benchmark.cc]].
* Phase Transition
The phase transition is calculated both semi-analytically using the high-temperature expansion and in full numerical analysis.

** High-temperature expansion
The high-temperature expansion of the scalar effective potential offers a convenient way to perform analytical computation. The analytical calculation of high-T effective potential are calculated in [[file:phase_transition/highT.nb][Mathematica code]]. Plots can also be find in the same Mathematica code.

Near the boundary where the critical temperature is ill-defined, the critical temperature quickly diverges up and plots suffer from numerical fluctuation.

* Higgs Signal
The Higgs and the new light scalar are mixed, leading to new signal. We calculated the Higgs exotic decay as well as the new scalar production and detection.
** New scalar production and detection
Scalar coupling with SM particles under our convention are calculated by hand.
The collider bounds are derived from the references described in the paper. The code for the LEP bound of scalar production is in [[file:collider/LEP.nb][LEP.nb]]. The one for the Higgs exotic decay search from LHC can be found in [[file:collider/Higgs_exotic.nb][Higgs_exotic.nb]].
