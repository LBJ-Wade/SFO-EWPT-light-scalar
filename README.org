* Introduction
This is the source code for the paper "Strong First Order Electroweak Phase Transition from a Natually Light Singlet Scalar".

* Mass spectrum
The scalar mass spectrum are calculated in Mathematica code [[file:mass_spectrum.nb][mass_spectrum.nb]].
Masses for other relavent particles are trivial and did not included in any code.
